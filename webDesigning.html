        <h1 style="text-align:center">Overview of Web Designing</h1>
        <p>
            Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
            websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI
            design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX
            design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering
            different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term
            "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side)
            design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the
            broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and
            be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

        <h3>User experience design and interactive design</h3>
        <p>
            User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works.
            This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and
            labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the
            interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to
            continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet
            less
            intuitive or less user-friendly website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience
            are
            less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend
            for
            a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of
            user
            skill.[11] Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface
            design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether
            or
            not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the
            plug-in
            doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how
            or
            the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding
            language
            skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the
            function
            will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with
            older
            browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse
            for
            the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or
            worth any risks.
