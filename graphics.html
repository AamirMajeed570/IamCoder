    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why Graphics Designing</h1>
    <p>
        Graphic design is an applied art and profession[2] that uses text and graphics to communicate visually. Graphic
        design is an interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and a branch of the fine arts. Its practice involves
        creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools.

        The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message.
        They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the
        aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey
        ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expreses. The design work can be based on a customer’s
        demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that
        graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.[3]

        Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication
        system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation
        world[4] or space exploration.[5][6] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only
        associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a
        small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

        With origins in antiquity and the Middle Ages,[7] graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom
        of rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial
        Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profesión in the West, closely associated with advertising in
        the 19th century[8] and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive
        growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly
        because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the
        competence of the engineers who develop them.[9]

        A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of existing text, ornament, and images.

        The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which
        messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic
        school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning;
        communication as an agent.</p>
